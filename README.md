Simple Microservice <br><br>

I specifically used Python3(version 3.13.7) to execute the code.<br><br>

Commands I Performed In the Intellij Terminal To Run The Application
1. python3 -m venv venv
2. source venv/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. python3 main.py <br>
You should then be able to interact with the application at http://localhost:8000/
